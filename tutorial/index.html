    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        This tutorial aims to show you how to trace messages inside Akka system.
        You will be guided through the tracing basics, sampling, trace logging, hierarchical calls and spray integration.
        To see actual results you will need to have Zipkin installed. Don't worry,
        template contains script that installs and runs it.
    </p>

    <h3>Akka Tracing</h3>

    <p>
        It is an <a href="https://github.com/levkhomich/akka-tracing">Akka distributed tracing extension</a>
        which can be used as performance diagnostics and debugging tool. Distributed nature of Zipkin
        (which it is based on) provides synergy with akka-remote and akka-cluster. Extension integrates with
        Finagle services and Spray toolkit.
    </p>

    <h3>Zipkin</h3>

    <p>
        <a href="http://twitter.github.io/zipkin/architecture.html" target="_blank">Zipkin</a> is a distributed tracing
        system that helps to gather timing data for all the disparate services. It manages both the collection
        and lookup of this data through a Collector and a Query service. Zipkin was modelled after the Google Dapper paper.

        But it's better to see once:

    <h2>Template overview</h2>

    <p>
        This template consists of several parts:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/TracingBasics.scala" class="shortcut">Tracing basics example</a> -
                shows basic steps required to trace request inside your app;
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/TraceHierarchy.scala" class="shortcut">Trace hierarchy example</a> -
                shows how to trace call hierarchies;
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/SprayDirectives.scala" class="shortcut">Spray integration example</a> -
                shows spray directives which can be used to enable tracing starting from http layer;
            </li>
            <li>
                Also, you can take a look on <a href="#code/src/main/java/sample/javaapi/TraceHierarchy.java" class="shortcut">Java example</a>
                showing Java API.
            </li>
        </ul>

        You can run any example and see traces using Zipkin Web UI.

    <h2>Setup</h2>

    <h3>Install script</h3>

    <p>Template provides simple script that can pull, build and run Zipkin server. Just run this command from project's dir:</p>

<pre><code>./zipkin.sh install && ./zipkin.sh start
</code></pre>

    <p>To stop Zipkin, type</p>

<pre><code>./zipkin.sh stop
</code></pre>

    <p>Installation can take up to 10-15 minutes, so it's a good time to take a cup of tea before you continue reading.</p>

    <h3>Another Way</h3>

    <p>If you want to install Zipkin manually, follow this steps...</p>

    <p>Clone project from its official repo:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/opt && cd ~/opt
git clone https://github.com/twitter/zipkin.git && cd zipkin
</code></pre>

    <p>Tracing extension only requires collector service running:</p>

<pre><code>bin/collector</code></pre>

    <p>To actually search and inspect traces, launch query and web services in different bash sessions:</p>

<pre><code>bin/query
bin/web
</code></pre>

    <p>Zipkin Web UI will be available via <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.</p>

    <p>More comprehensive setup guide can be found <a href="http://twitter.github.io/zipkin/install.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Tracing overview</h2>

    <p>Every message's trace lifecycle consists of several stages:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>Sampling</em>. Before actual trace is created, message needs to be successfully sampled.
            Such mechanism allows setup tracing extension to sample only some part of messages to reduce
            overhead when used in production environment.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Annotating</em>. Any (created) trace can be annotated by basic and binary annotations.
            Basic annotations contain timestamp and description and can be displayed in timeline. Binary
            annotations are key-value pairs attached to trace itself.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Submitting</em>. After some message was explicitly marked as response to traced message,
            corresponding trace is sent to (external) collector service. If response remains unspecified,
            trace will be sent anyway after some timeout. Any annotations written to already submitted
            trace are ignored.
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Tracing API</h2>

    <h3>Scala</h3>

    <p>
        All you need is to mark all traceable messages your system uses with <code>TracingSupport</code> trait and
        mix all actors from which you want to annotate your traces with <code>ActorTracing</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Java</h3>

    <p>While you can access all tracing features from Java API, it can be confusing sometimes.</p>

    <p>You have two options on how to mark your traceable messages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>extend <code>japi.TracingSupport</code></li>
        <li>implement <code>BaseTracingSupport</code> and it's methods as it done in
            <a href="https://github.com/levkhomich/akka-tracing/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/github/levkhomich/akka/tracing/japi/TracingSupport.java"><code>japi.TracingSupport</code></a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>To access extension itself, define <code>trace</code> field:</p>

<pre><code>TracingExtensionImpl trace = (TracingExtensionImpl) TracingExtension.apply(context().system());
</code></pre>

    <h3>Sampling</h3>

    <p>
        Sampling is performed using <code>trace.sample(msg, serviceName, rpcName)</code> method.
        It's recommended to call this method right after message was received by your actor system.
        Sampling rate can be changed using <code>akka.tracing.sample-rate</code> config parameter.
    </p>

    <h3>Trace annotations</h3>

    <p>There are several methods allowing you to annotate traces:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <code>trace.record(msg, annotation)</code> - attaches string annotation to message trace timeline.
            Such annotations can be used by <code>annotation</code> filter in Web UI.</li>
        <li>
            <code>trace.recordKeyValue(msg, key, value)</code> - annotates trace by key-value pair,
            where value can be represented by String, Short, Int, Long, Boolean, Double or Array[Byte].
            This kind of annotations can be used by <code>key-value</code> filter in Web UI.</li>
        <li>
            <code>trace.recordException(msg, exception)</code> - writes exception's stack trace to trace.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submitting</h2>

    <p>
        After you mark that message processing was finished by marking response with
        <code>someMessage.asResponseTo(request)</code>. Corresponding trace will be closed and submitted
        to collector service.
    </p>

    <h2>Project setup</h2>

    <h3>SBT</h3>

    <p>Include extension to the list of your project's dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>libraryDependencies += "com.github.levkhomich" %% "akka-tracing-core" % "0.2"
</code></pre>

    <p>or, if you want to experiment with snapshot (and that's what this template does):</p>

<pre><code>resolvers += "Sonatype snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"

libraryDependencies += "com.github.levkhomich" %% "akka-tracing-core" % "0.3-SNAPSHOT" changing()
</code></pre>

    <h3>Typesafe config</h3>

    <p>You will need to define collector's endpoint:</p>

<pre><code>akka.tracing {
  host = "localhost"
  port = 9410 # default
}</code></pre>

    <p>Also you can setup extension to be initialized with actor system (it's not required, though):</p>

<pre><code>
akka.extensions += "com.github.levkhomich.akka.tracing.TracingExtension"
</code></pre>
